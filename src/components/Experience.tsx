          At Netshift Digital Ltd., I served as a mobile developer, where I spearheaded the development of two significant projects:
<br/><br/>
Tabilli: A user-friendly application designed to streamline the process of making restaurant reservations. My contributions included developing a smooth and intuitive interface, integrating real-time booking capabilities, and ensuring compatibility across multiple devices and platforms.
<br/><br/>

Tabilli Restaurant App: This companion app was developed specifically for restaurant owners and staff to manage reservations effectively. 
<br/><br/>
I focused on creating a robust backend for handling booking data, implementing features for real-time updates and notifications, and optimizing the app for seamless performance.

In my role, I collaborated closely with designers, product managers, and other developers to deliver high-quality solutions. I leveraged my expertise in Flutter and native mobile development to ensure the applications were not only functional but also provided an excellent user experience. These projects enhanced my skills in app optimization, real-time data handling, and developing user-centric mobile applications.
